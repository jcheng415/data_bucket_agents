Interviewer: Can you tell me about your experience accessing healthcare?
Interviewee: The upfront cost was over $2,000 HKD and I couldn't pay without a waiver. It took me four days just to get the waiver interview, and my condition was getting worse. The staff didn't recognize my documents at first. When I finally saw the specialist, they didn't have an interpreter available.

Interviewer: How did that make you feel?
Interviewee: The whole process made me feel like they didn't want to help people like me. I felt the system wasn't organized to handle trauma survivors.
